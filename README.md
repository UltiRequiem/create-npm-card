# Create NPM Card

Have you seen all the [NPM cards](https://github.com/topics/npm-card) on GitHub
and now you want one too?

This repository tries to help you make one easily.

## Use

```sh
npx create-npm-card <name>
```

> You will be asked some questions 👀

Now there is a new directory called `<name>`.

You can edit `src/cli.js` and `src/config.js` freely, all is plain JavaScript,
use your creativity!

After editing that files, or maybe not, just run

```sh
node src/cli.js
```

To publish run

```sh
npm publish
```

That's all 🚀

> [npm publish docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-publish)

```sh
npx ultirequiem
```
